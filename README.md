# PDFStitcher
PDFSticher is a utility for stitching together many PDF pages from one document into a single page. This is also called "N-Up" or page imposition. This program was created in order to convert sewing patterns into a convenient format for projecting, though it could be used to stitch together any PDF.

Since version 0.4, it is also possible to select layers for inclusion/exclusion in the final output. Additionally, line properties can be modified for each layer if the input PDF is compatible.
